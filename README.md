# bRealTime-Chrome-Extension
Creating a Chrome extension to view Publisher bRealTime 360 Header Bidding information

Initial load of base files on 12/14. 

Functionality will include:
1) Being able to read if bRealTime Header Bidding is included on the page.
2) Seeing what demand partners are setup.


Future consideration:
1) Complete reproduction of biddr console product in extension.
